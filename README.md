This is a playground with common CS algorithms. The goal is to have simple implementations focused on comprehension.
It's updated from time to time, currently it includes:
- Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path on a 2d grid
- Redâ€“black binary search tree [info](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/supplement/zQXMd/lecture-slides)
- Sorting
  - Insertion [info](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/supplement/erHuw/lecture-slides)
  - Merge [info](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/supplement/4E9fa/lecture-slides)
  - Quick [info](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/supplement/efbDN/lecture-slides)
  - Quick (3-way)
  - Heap [info](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/supplement/eHe3d/lecture-slides)
- Interesting tasks from the "Cracking the Coding Interview"
